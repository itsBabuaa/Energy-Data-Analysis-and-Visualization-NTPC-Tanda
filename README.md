# Energy Data Analysis & Visualization using Streamlit

This repository contains the code and resources for the **Energy Data Analysis & Visualization** project. The project focuses on analyzing energy generation, demand, coal usage, and waste data using Python and Streamlit to build an interactive dashboard with forecasting capabilities.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Power plants like NTPC Tanda generate large amounts of operational data. Traditional reporting methods are static and slow, which makes it difficult to derive actionable insights. This project aims to:

âœ” Analyze NTPCâ€™s energy data  
âœ” Visualize trends using graphs and charts  
âœ” Implement forecasting using ARIMA models  
âœ” Provide interactive dashboards for monitoring and planning
